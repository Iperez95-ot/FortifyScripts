# 🔒 Tomcat10SSLConfig (Fortify SSC Tomcat 10.x SSL Configuration Script)

This script automates the process of **configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** for an **Apache Tomcat 10.x** instance running the **OpenText Application Security (Fortify SSC)** web application on a Linux system.
It creates and applies self-signed SSL certificates, updates Tomcat configuration files, modifies Fortify SSC settings, and ensures the service runs securely over HTTPS.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔑 Automatically generates private key and certificate files.
* 🧩 Creates PKCS#12 (`.p12`) keystore for Tomcat integration.
* 🛡️ Adds certificate to the system's trusted CA store.
* 🔗 Inserts SSL Connector configuration in `server.xml`.
* 🧱 Updates Fortify SSC `app.properties` with the new HTTPS URL.
* ⚙️ Enables SOAP API support in SSC.
* 🔁 Restarts Tomcat service after SSL configuration.

## 🧾 Requirements

* 🐧 Linux-based OS (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.).
* 🔧 `openssl`, `awk`, `sed`, and `systemctl` installed.
* 🌍 Proper permissions to manage the Tomcat service and modify system CA.
* 📄 `.env` file configured with the following variables:

The values are at the discretion of each user.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

```
Tomcat9SSLConfig/
|     ├── tomcat10_ssl_config.sh     # Script that applies the SSL configuration on Apache Tomcat 10 for Fortify SSC.
|     └── .env                       # Environment variables file used by the Apache Tomcat 10 SSL configuration script. 
└──────────────────────────────
```

---

## 🧰 Usage

1. **Ensure environment variables are defined** in a `.env` file.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x tomcat10_ssl_config.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./tomcat10_ssl_config.sh
   ```

---

## 🧱 Components Used

* 🐚 **Bash** – Automation script.
* 🧰 **OpenSSL** – Certificate and key generation.
* 🐱 **Apache Tomcat 10.x** – Application server.
* 🛡️ **OpenText Application Security (Fortify SSC)** – Secure code analysis web app.

---

## 📝 Notes

* The script **detects if SSL is already configured** and exits gracefully if found.
* A `.bak` backup of `server.xml` and `app.properties` is automatically created.
* Make sure Tomcat service name matches `fortify_ssc_tomcat` in your systemd unit.
